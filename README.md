## üìò ES6 Questions & Answers

### 1) What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
- **var**
  - Function-scoped  
  - Hoisted (initialized to `undefined`)  
  - Can be re-declared  
- **let**
  - Block-scoped  
  - Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ applies)  
  - Can be re-assigned but not re-declared in the same scope  
- **const**
  - Block-scoped  
  - Must be initialized once  
  - Cannot be re-assigned  
  - For objects/arrays ‚Üí binding is constant, but internal values can change  

---

### 2) What is the difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`?
- **forEach**
  - Iterates through array  
  - Executes callback for side effects  
  - Always returns `undefined`  
- **map**
  - Transforms each element  
  - Returns a **new array** of the same length  
- **filter**
  - Selects elements where callback returns truthy  
  - Returns a **new array** (possibly shorter)  

---

### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
- Concise syntax for writing functions  
- Lexical `this` (does not bind its own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`)  
- Cannot be used as constructors  
- Supports **implicit return** when using expression body  

---

### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
- Extracts values from arrays/objects into variables using pattern matching  
- Supports:  
  - Default values  
  - Variable renaming  
  - Nested patterns  
  - Rest operator (`...rest`)  
- Works in **function parameters**  

---

### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
- Written with backticks (`` ` ``)  
- Allow **multi-line strings**  
- Allow **interpolation** with `${expression}`  
- Easier to read than `'a' + x + 'b'`  
- Support **tagged templates** for advanced use cases
